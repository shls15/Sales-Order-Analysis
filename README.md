## Author
Shloka Shetty

## About
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of sales orders using Python (with Pandas) and SQL. The dataset was sourced using the Kaggle API, followed by extensive data cleaning and transformation processes. The cleaned data was then loaded into a SQL database for further analysis through optimized queries.

The project aims to uncover meaningful sales trends and insights by leveraging advanced data manipulation techniques.

## Features
- Data Sourcing: Automated retrieval of the dataset using the Kaggle API.
- Data Cleaning: Performed using Pandas to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize fields.
- SQL Integration: Loaded data into a SQL database to perform queries for efficient data analysis.
- Insight Generation: Identified sales trends, customer patterns, and key performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Languages: Python, SQL
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
- Tools: Kaggle API, Jupyter Notebook, MySQL

## Project Workflow
1. Dataset Acquisition:
   - Dataset sourced programmatically using the Kaggle API.

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation:
   - Handled missing values, standardized formats, and performed initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).

3. Database Integration:
   - Structured and loaded the cleaned data into an SQL database for better query efficiency.

4. Analysis:
   - Conducted SQL queries to answer key business questions like:
     - Top-selling products
     - Seasonal trends in sales
     - Customer segmentation based on order behavior
